IBM/Coursera Peer-graded Assignment
Assignment Topic: Completing an Empty Jupyterlite Notebook

In this assignment, I was provided with an empty Jupyterlite notebook and launched it in the course environment. The goal was to complete the notebook by including a combination of markdown and code cells. The task did not require me to consult the Markdown cheat sheet to determine the appropriate syntax for my markdown.

To fulfill the assignment requirements, I utilized markdown cells to provide explanations, headings, and formatting, while code cells were used to write and execute Python code. The notebook was structured in a logical manner, with clear documentation and code organization.

By successfully completing this assignment, I demonstrated proficiency in using Jupyterlite, understanding markdown syntax, and effectively combining markdown and code cells to create a comprehensive notebook.
